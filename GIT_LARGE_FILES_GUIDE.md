# Keeping Large Files Out of Your Git Repository

## ‚úÖ What I've Done

1. **Updated `.gitignore`** to comprehensively exclude:
   - `data/*` - All downloaded PDFs, transcripts, and processed files
   - `clearcouncil_env/` - Virtual environment (can be huge!)
   - `*.pdf`, `*.csv` - Individual large files
   - `*.log` - Log files
   - Cache and temporary files

2. **Removed tracked large files** from Git:
   - Removed entire `clearcouncil_env/` virtual environment from tracking
   - Removed `results.csv` from tracking

## üîí Files Now Protected From Sync

Your `.gitignore` now prevents these from being committed:

### Data Files (The Big Ones!)
- `data/PDFs/` - All downloaded council documents
- `data/faiss_indexes/` - Vector database files
- `data/results/` - Analysis results and charts
- `data/transcripts/` - YouTube transcripts

### Environment & Dependencies
- `clearcouncil_env/` - Virtual environment (hundreds of MB)
- `*.log` - Log files

### Generated Files
- `*.csv` - Analysis results
- `*.pdf` - Any PDFs created during processing
- `__pycache__/` - Python cache files

## üéØ What This Means

‚úÖ **SAFE TO COMMIT:**
- Source code changes
- Configuration files
- Documentation
- Small example files

‚ùå **WILL NOT BE COMMITTED:**
- Downloaded council documents (potentially GBs)
- Virtual environment files
- Generated analysis files
- Logs and cache files

## üìä Repository Size Impact

**Before:** Your repo might have grown to hundreds of MB or GB with:
- Virtual environment: ~200-500 MB
- Downloaded PDFs: Potentially GBs
- Processing results: 10s-100s of MB

**After:** Your repo stays lean with only:
- Source code: <10 MB
- Configuration: <1 MB
- Documentation: <5 MB

## üîÑ For Team Collaboration

When someone else clones your repo, they'll need to:

1. **Set up their own environment:**
   ```bash
   ./setup_complete.sh
   ```

2. **Add their own API key:**
   ```bash
   # Edit .env file
   OPENAI_API_KEY=their_key_here
   ```

3. **Download their own data:**
   ```bash
   python clearcouncil.py download-pdfs york_county_sc
   ```

This is **GOOD** because:
- Each person controls their own data
- No API key sharing issues
- Faster clones and pulls
- No storage quota issues on GitHub

## üõ°Ô∏è Additional Protection

If you want to double-check what's being tracked:

```bash
# See what files Git is tracking
git ls-files | head -20

# Check repo size
du -sh .git

# See what's staged for commit
git status
```

## üö® Emergency: If Large Files Accidentally Get Committed

If you accidentally commit large files:

```bash
# Remove from last commit (if not pushed yet)
git reset --soft HEAD~1
git reset HEAD large_file.pdf
git commit -m "Remove large files"

# For files already pushed, use git filter-branch or BFG Repo-Cleaner
```

Your repository is now properly configured to stay lean and efficient! üéâ
